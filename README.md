# Chest Monitor
A cool monitor displaying the items in your chest for Minecraft. 

## Installation
The setup is relatively straight forward, start by installing the mod for ComputerCraft on Curseforge:
https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked

Once you've opened up the monitor in minecraft, run the following command:
```
wget run https://github.com/IggyDeveloper1/chest-monitor/blob/main/install.lua
```

This will automatically create and run all of the required scripts to get you started.
And that's all! Enjoy your monitor displaying the items in your chests.
